This is the current format for the config.json file that is read on bot start. To make this work with your bot, you'll
need to input your discord token, as well as and openweatherapi. maxPoints can be customised for the short name of the
wind directions. When setting up the bot to run yourself, delete all the plain text outside the {} and rename this file
config.json. Then assign the appropriate values to dToken and openweatherapi. Enjoy!
